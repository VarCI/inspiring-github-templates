# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in helping out!

Because this is an automatically generated list, all changes made
directly to the `README.md` file will be lost on the next update.

To add a repository's templates to the list, just add its `full_name` to
the `STICKY.txt` list.

Similarly, you can help curating the bots findings by adding repositories
to the `BLACKLIST.txt`.
