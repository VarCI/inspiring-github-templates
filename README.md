<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>## FreeCodeCamp Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

  2.1. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

  2.2. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

  2.3. You have only one commit (if not, [squash](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one) them into one commit).

  2.4. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

  3.1. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on FreeCodeCamp's repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.

  3.2. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

  3.3. Provide a description of your changes.

  3.4. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**

#### .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor) for that, or you may want to start a discussion on the [Meteor forum](https://forums.meteor.com/).

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

### When reporting a bug, please be sure to include the following:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] What version of Meteor you're using, and the platform(s) you're running it on
- [ ] What packages or other dependencies you're using
- [ ] The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior
- [ ] An *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior (example: GitHub repository with code isolated to the issue that anyone can clone to observe the problem)

See [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md#reporting-a-bug-in-meteor) for more detail on what is expected of a bug report.

### When you open an issue for a feature request, please add as much detail as possible:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better

See [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md#feature-requests) for more detail on what is expected of a feature request.

### Independent core packages

We've split some packages out of meteor/meteor in order to make it easier for community members to contribute and the MDG team to maintain a slimmer core (this enables us to untie package versions from Meteor releases). Please ensure your issue is opened against the appropriate repository. Packages that have been split from core and their repositories are:

- Blaze: https://github.com/meteor/blaze

#### .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

Note that we are unlikely to accept pull requests that add features without prior discussion. The best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.

Always follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Contributing.md) when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.

#### ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>Hey there and thank you for using React Native!

React Native, as you've probably heard, is getting really popular and truth is we're getting a bit overwhelmed by the activity surrounding it. There are just too many issues for us to manage properly.

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native). We use StackOverflow for usage question and GitHub for bugs.
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Post the feature request on [Product Pains](https://productpains.com/product/react-native/). It has a voting system to surface the important issues. GitHub issues should only be used for bugs.


None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** / [rnplay](https://rnplay.org/) example that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] What's the **version** of React Native you're using?
- [ ] Does this occur on iOS, Android or both?
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
</code></pre>



#### PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>Thanks for submitting a pull request! Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

(You can skip this if you're fixing a typo or adding an app to the Showcase.)

Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

Prefer **small pull requests**. These are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

**Test plan (required)**

Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes UI.

Make sure tests pass on both Travis and Circle CI.

**Code formatting**

Look around. Match the style of the rest of the codebase. See also the simple [style guide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guide).

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>Before submitting a pull request, make sure it's targeting the right branch:

- For documentation fixes, use `master`.
- For bug fixes, use `develop`.
- For new features, use the branch for the next minor version, which will be formatted `v6.x`.

If you're fixing a JavaScript issue, it would help to create a new test case under the folder `test/visual/` that recreates the issue and show's that it's been fixed. Run `npm test` to compile the testing folder.

Happy coding! :)

## Contributing

The project is in maintenance mode, meaning, changes are driven by contributed patches.
There is otherwise no active development or roadmap for this project. It is "DIY".

Only proposed changes in the form of a pull request are likely to be acted on, but,
these will be acted on promptly.

### Questions

Questions should be asked on the mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zxing

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are not accepted and will generally be closed.

- Please verify that your code satisfies the
[code/documentation quality guidelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines).
- Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` if the
contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review.

- Incomplete contributions should be prefixed `[WIP]` to indicate a work
in progress (and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures). WIPs may be useful
to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a
[task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
in the PR description.
- Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to
be accepted.
- If you are adding an enhancement, you may wish to provide evidence for
its benefit with distinguishing examples in the code and benchmarks
in the PR discussion.
- If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the title to describe
the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description to
ensure a link is created to the original issue.

Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is
necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value
all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to
review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either
case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.

#### .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>### Are you looking for help?

This is an issue tracker, used to manage and track the development of Play. It is not a support system and so it is not a place to ask questions or get help. If you're not sure if you have found a bug, the best place to start is with either the [users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=playframework). If you have a feature request, the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-dev) is a better forum than an issue tracker to discuss it.

### Play Version (2.5.x / etc)



### API (Scala / Java / Neither / Both)



### Operating System (Ubuntu 15.10 / MacOS 10.10 / Windows 10)

Use `uname -a` if on Linux.

### JDK (Oracle 1.8.0_72, OpenJDK 1.8.x, Azul Zing)

Paste the output from `java -version` at the command line.

### Library Dependencies

If this is an issue that involves integration with another system, include the exact version and OS of the other system, including any intermediate drivers or APIs i.e. if you connect to a PostgreSQL database, include both the version / OS of PostgreSQL and the JDBC driver version used to connect to the database.

### Expected Behavior

Please describe the expected behavior of the issue, starting from the first action.

1.
2.
3.

### Actual Behavior

Please provide a description of what actually happens, working from the same starting point.

Be descriptive: "it doesn't work" does not describe what the behavior actually is -- instead, say "the page renders a 500 error code with no body content."  Copy and paste logs, and include any URLs.  Turn on internal Play logging with `<logger name="play" value="TRACE"/>` if there is no log output.  

1.
2.
3.

### Reproducible Test Case

Please provide a PR with a failing test.  

If the issue is more complex or requires configuration, please provide a link to a project on Github that reproduces the issue.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. *Load save game attached to this ticket*

2.

3.

#### Save Game
*It is often useful for us if you have a save game from shortly before the
issue occurs that can be used to recreate the problem. Sometimes a save that
shows the issue happening may be useful as well. As GitHub currently only
supports uploading of images, you will have to upload your your savegames to
an another source such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com),
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), or
[SkyDrive/OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com). Add the link to the file to
your issue and make the file(s) public, so we can access your gamelog or
savegame. The most important thing is to not remove these files after you
uploaded them!*

#### Expected Behavior

#### System Information
**CorsixTH Version:** *e.g. 0.50 or 7d886f35ca*

**Operating System:** *e.g. Windows 10*

**Theme Hospital Version:** *CD, GOG.com, Origin, or Demo*
